# CV
My latest CV
And cover letter.

I recently moved to Toowoomba which is about 90 minutes due west of Brisbane, so by necessity I am available only for remote roles.  (Unless they are nearby.)

My preference is for native iOS development using Swift and SwiftUI.

Please see the cover letter for a more "promotional" presentation.
