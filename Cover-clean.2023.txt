Hi,

I'm interested in the iOS Developer role.

I am an experienced software developer. I’ve worked on enterprise-scale apps as part of one team among many teams, as the sole developer, and everywhere in between.  I've worked in cross-functional and multicultural teams.  I’ve worked on greenfield apps, legacy apps, and those in between.

I've worked on around 30 different apps, almost all in Swift, most of which have been deployed.  I've placed six apps in the App Store as the sole developer.

I've worked with Swift since it was introduced -- downloaded the original language spec and then the first Xcode beta supporting it.  And been using SwiftUI almost exclusively since it was available.

A few years ago I published several SwiftUI open source repositories on GitHub - SwiftUIReference, SwiftUICombined, Classic Life, and GridDragView.  The first two are SwiftUI example applications.  Classic Life is a tribute to John H Conway.  GridDragView is a SwiftUI grid View control.  All this code is now several years old and already horribly out-of-date.

I've worked with the following Frameworks and SDKs:
• SwiftUI, UIKit, ARKit, AVFoundation, Cocoa Touch, Combine, CoreData, CoreGraphics, CoreLocation, CoreML, GameKit, MessageUI, PDFKit, ResearchKit.
• Agora, Alamofire, AppAuth, AudioKit, Auth0, AEXML, GraphQL, mbedTLS, RxSwift, SeeScoreLib, SwiftProtoBuf, Swinject.
• Firebase,AWS SDK, Facebook SDK, Agora, GraphQL, AmazonFreeRTOS.
Networking has been with JSON from both RESTful and nonRESTful backends.

I'm familiar with all stages of the software development life cycle (SDLC) – from concept to application design and specification to software design and development to maintenance.

I eat learning curves for lunch. (And make order out of chaos.)

My specialties are software development and design. iOS - Swift (and Objective-C), SwiftUI.

Recent projects have been based in Xcode and managed using Agile development methods, generally a mixture of Scrum and Kanban. Tools have included JIRA plus JIRA Agile and Confluence, Git, GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, SourceTree, SPM, and CocoaPods/Carthage. Currently working mainly in Swift and SwiftUI with a little UIKit when necessary.

Thanks,
David
